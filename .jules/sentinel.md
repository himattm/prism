## 2024-05-12 - Prevent Path Traversal in Plugin Manager
**Vulnerability:** Untrusted plugin metadata (like `# @name` in scripts) and URLs could be manipulated to contain path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), allowing arbitrary files to be overwritten or removed.
**Learning:** Go's `filepath.Join` automatically calls `filepath.Clean` which evaluates `../` sequences, making it vulnerable when user-provided or untrusted inputs are directly appended to a base directory path.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize untrusted input used in file paths by applying `filepath.Base(filepath.Clean("/" + name))` to enforce that only the base filename is used, effectively dropping directory escape attempts.
